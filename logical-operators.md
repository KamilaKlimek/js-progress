**Logical Operators**

Today's sources:

[You don't know JS - Logical Operators](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20&%20grammar/ch4.md#operators--and-)

[Marius Schultz - The || and && Operators](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2016/05/25/the-andand-and-operator-in-javascript)

I had to step away from FCC for a moment after completing Basic Algorithm scripting because I realize that I don't know the language enough to actually understand what's happening in the program in the next section. I figured it will make more sense to come back when I have deeper understanding of JS & its' syntax and can churn out code more naturally.

I decided it was high I reached for a more comprehensive source that will give me a good foundation and so I bought [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). From there, going through logical operators gave me a pause. Given how much they can minimize the code, I wanted to have complete understanding of how they work and how to use them. The sources listed at the top of the page were extremely helpful with that.

Goal for this week: finish the "language" part of the book by the end of this week and resume FCC for one hour at some point to see if I'm ready to go back to it.
